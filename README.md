# Iot Health Care Monitoring System

### Hey Javier and JT bruch,

This project right now is not in a good form and there is some files missing like Dockerfile which was built everytime and pushed to Azure Container Registry(ACR) to trigger the continous deployment on Azure App Service (Web apps for containers platform). Sorry about that, Actually it was not available on my github repo I found it on my computer so I organize some code files into these folders. So, you will get some idea by looking at these files that what was going on. 
Also, the User Interface is not good and these are random static HTML files that I used, I just dislplayed the sensor readings by creating some logic and not worked much on the User Interface.

So looking forward to talk to you again soon!
