# Iot Health Care Monitoring System

## Hey Javier and JT bruch,

## This project right now is not in a good form, Sorry about that ,Actually it was not available on my github repo I found it on my computer so I organize some code files I ##found into these folders. So,you will get some idea by looking at these files that what is going. 
## Also, the User Interface is not good and these are random static HTML files that we used, I just dslplayed the sensor readings and not worked much on the User Interface.
